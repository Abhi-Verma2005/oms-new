# Checkout Flow Fix - Order Creation After Payment

## Problem
The checkout flow in mosaic-next was not creating orders after successful payment. The payment was being processed but no order records were being saved to the database.

## Root Cause
The mosaic-next project was missing:
1. Stripe webhook handler to process payment completion events
2. Payment intent creation with proper metadata for order creation
3. Order creation API endpoint

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Created Stripe Webhook Handler
**File:** `app/api/webhooks/stripe/route.ts`

- Handles `payment_intent.succeeded` events
- Creates orders with `PAID` status after successful payment
- Creates associated transaction records
- Handles `payment_intent.payment_failed` events
- Creates failed orders for tracking purposes

### 2. Updated Payment Intent Creation
**File:** `app/api/payment-intent/route.ts`

- Added authentication check
- Added items parameter to request body
- Added metadata to payment intent including:
  - `userId`: User ID for order creation
  - `items`: JSON stringified cart items
  - `orderType`: Type of order (purchase)

### 3. Updated Checkout Client
**File:** `app/checkout/CheckoutClient.tsx`

- Modified payment intent creation to include cart items
- Items are mapped to the required format for the webhook
- Added items dependency to useEffect

### 4. Added Order Creation API
**File:** `app/api/orders/route.ts`

- Added POST method for creating orders
- Requires explicit status (PAID, FAILED, or CANCELLED)
- Creates order items and transaction records
- Includes proper error handling and validation

## Flow Summary

### Before (Broken Flow)
1. User visits checkout page
2. Payment intent created without metadata
3. Payment processed successfully
4. **No order created** ❌
5. Cart cleared but no order record

### After (Fixed Flow)
1. User visits checkout page
2. Payment intent created with user and items metadata
3. Payment processed successfully
4. Stripe webhook receives `payment_intent.succeeded` event
5. **Order created with PAID status** ✅
6. Transaction record created
7. Cart cleared and user redirected

## Environment Variables Required

```env
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=sk_test_...
NEXT_PUBLIC_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_test_...
STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET=whsec_...
```

## Testing

### Manual Testing
1. Add items to cart
2. Go to checkout page
3. Complete payment with Stripe test card
4. Check orders page - should see new order

### Automated Testing
Run the test script:
```bash
node scripts/test-checkout-flow.mjs
```

## Webhook Setup

1. In Stripe Dashboard, go to Webhooks
2. Add endpoint: `https://yourdomain.com/api/webhooks/stripe`
3. Select events: `payment_intent.succeeded`, `payment_intent.payment_failed`
4. Copy webhook secret to `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET`

## Database Impact

- Orders are only created after successful payment
- No PENDING orders are created
- All orders have final status (PAID, FAILED, or CANCELLED)
- Transaction records are created for each order

## Files Modified

- `app/api/webhooks/stripe/route.ts` (new)
- `app/api/payment-intent/route.ts` (updated)
- `app/checkout/CheckoutClient.tsx` (updated)
- `app/api/orders/route.ts` (updated)
- `scripts/test-checkout-flow.mjs` (new)

## Verification

After implementing these changes:
1. ✅ Payment intents include proper metadata
2. ✅ Stripe webhook creates orders after successful payment
3. ✅ Orders API can create orders manually
4. ✅ Orders are visible in the orders page
5. ✅ Failed payments create failed order records
